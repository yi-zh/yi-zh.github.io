I am Yi Zhang, an __Optimization Research Scientist__ at [__The Optimization Firm__](https://minlp.com/home) working on global optimization and artificial intelligence.

I have been enjoying developing optimization solvers and studying mathematics ever since, and I am still loving every minute of my work. In short, here are the roles that define me:

- Admirer and developer (2017-Now) of global mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver: [__BARON__](https://minlp.com/baron-solver)

- Algorithm Expert (2019-2021) in designing optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms for cross-border e-commerce logistics scenarios in [__Cainiao-Alibaba Group__](https://www.cainiao.com/en/index.html) and [__Lazada Group__](https://www.lazada.com/en/)

- PhD (2014-2019) in Control Science and Engineering,  [__Zhejiang University__](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/), with emphasis on modeling, simulation, optimization in process system engineering

- Researcher that never retires and always enjoys studying

[//]: # (- Please allow me to introduce my role model here who I always look up to: [Prof. Egon Balas]&#40;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Balas&#41; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLnELKgtIM0&t=974s" class="label video">Video</a>)

My current research focuses on advancing theories and algorithms in global optimization for Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), developing AI-powered optimization software, and enabling data-driven decision-making in manufacturing. Among all the projects I'm working on, now I have a particular interest in [The Pooling Problem](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3532-1_9) and [Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization).

In my research journey (as some might see on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QAZD5GMAAAAJ&hl=en)), I enjoyed collaborating with outstanding professionals—whether students, engineers, or professors—to achieve meaningful breakthroughs, step by step. For more details of my experience, please check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-zhang-433567132/).

<!--
Before beginning my true research journey (as some might see on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QAZD5GMAAAAJ&hl=en)), I had always envisioned becoming a teacher, unaware of terms like 'academic' or 'professor.' However, destiny led me down a slightly different path, where I discovered that my true goal is to collaborate with outstanding professionals—whether students, engineers, or professors—to achieve meaningful breakthroughs, step by step. I may take on various roles within a team, not necessarily as the leader, but I always position myself to be responsible for driving the core advancements.

I am honored to introduce the individuals who shaped my research abilities, strengthened my theoretical foundation, and broadened my perspective on life.


- Prof. Nikolaos V. Sahinidis

- Prof. Gang Rong

- Prof. Yiping Feng
